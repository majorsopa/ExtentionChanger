# ExtensionChanger
Change the extensions of a large amount of files at once while preserving the original name, with a simple gui.  

# Intructions for Windows
1. Download "final.zip" from the releases tab
2. Extract
3. Run "main.exe"
4. Follow on-screen intructions from there

# Important Notice
If you file does not have an extension e.g. "example.", "example" it will rename the file and not add an extension.  
This does not actually change the file type, but instead changes the extension.
